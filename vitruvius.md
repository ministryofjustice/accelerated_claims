# Accelerated Claim app

This is the source code of what is currently a minimum viable product for the Civil Claims exemplar. The application consists in a single form that claimants of accelerated claims fill out to download a PDF. The PDF is the standard accelerated claim form from HMCTS, is filled out with the details that the claimant has provided, and can be signed and sent by post.


The scope of this phase of work is to digitise and improve the user experience of the form.

We are focusing on:

* helping users to understand what is being requested of them to complete this service
* helping first time users understand the information they are submitting
* reducing errors made in completion of the form
* reducing duplication necessary on the written form 

# Primary User Needs

As a claimant (private landlord) user I want:

* to access relevant information in one location
* to complete an online form without wider knowledge or the need to search for help
* to feel more confident that the accelerated possession claims is the correct claim for me and that I have filled it in correctly

As a court staff user I want:

* (long term benefit) to reduce the number of errors made on a form when submitted to court
* to reduce current paper based processes that lead to delays, document loss, errors and higher operation costs
* to reduce the number of customer service calls to call centers/courts

# Components
