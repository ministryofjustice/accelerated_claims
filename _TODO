TO DO ON NUM DEFENDANTS
=======================


- find out why defendnat 1 and 2 aren't being printed (prob defendant_one instead of defendant_1)
- work out why newlines are being duplicated in adresses on the continuation sheet


- work out how to implement claimant_collections in the form params
- ditto defendant_collections

- work out how to not populate property address for defendnats that inhapbit property
- work out how to not populate address for claimants who live at same address as claimant 1


- refactor select_number_of_defendants/claimants in claim_form.rb
